# Work Day Scheduler

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm

WHEN I view the time blocks for that day

THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or 
future

WHEN I click into a time block

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that time block

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist

## Usage
This application is quite straightforward. Simply click on the colored time block you'd like to save an event, or notes, within, then type whatever you would like into the box. After entering your text, click the save button on the right hand side. Now that you've clicked save you can refresh the page or leave and come back any time you'd like, and your inputs will automatically populate within each respective time block.

Grey indicates that the current time is past the grey time block's given time. Red indicates that the current time is within the same hour as the red time block's given time. A green time block indicates a future time.
